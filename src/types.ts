  // # Scaling Frontend Architecture in Enterprise Portals

  // As organizations scale, their frontend platforms often devolve into rigid monoliths. Features become interlocked, deployment speeds crater, and different engineering teams accidentally override each other's visual states. 

  // In this article, we outline a modern architecture designed to sustain complex client portals without sacrificing development velocity.

  // ## 1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD) in Frontend Folders
  // Instead of grouping files strictly by technical role (e.g., \`/components\`, \`/hooks\`, \`/services\`), structure your codebase by domain features. 

  // \`\`\`bash
  // src/
  // ├── domains/
  // │   ├── identity/
  // │   │   ├── components/
  // │   │   ├── hooks/
  // │   │   └── index.ts  # Clear public API contract
  // │   ├── telemetry/
  // │   └── billing/
  // ├── shared/
  // │   ├── ui-kit/
  // │   └── utils/
  // \`\`\`

  // By enforcing a strict contract where domains can only communicate through defined entry points (\`index.ts\`), you prevent spaghetti code and make future migrations a breeze.

  // ## 2. Enforcing Strict Type boundaries
  // Leverage TypeScript’s absolute imports and strict path mapping to lock down internal domain logic. Use ESLint rules to prevent developers from importing directly into the private folders of another domain.

  // ## 3. Bundle Budgets & Performance Guards
  // Implement rigid bundle budgets within your compiler configurations. If any single feature bundle exceeds **50KB gzipped**, the build system should generate warning alerts or actively block the integration pipeline.
  //     `
  //   },
