# Scaling Frontend Architecture in Enterprise Portals

As organizations scale, their frontend platforms often devolve into rigid monoliths. Features become interlocked, deployment speeds crater, and different engineering teams accidentally override each other's visual states. 

In this article, we outline a modern architecture designed to sustain complex client portals without sacrificing development velocity.

## 1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD) in Frontend Folders
Instead of grouping files strictly by technical role (e.g., \`/components\`, \`/hooks\`, \`/services\`), structure your codebase by domain features. 

\`\`\`bash
src/
├── domains/
│   ├── identity/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   └── index.ts  # Clear public API contract
│   ├── telemetry/
│   └── billing/
├── shared/
│   ├── ui-kit/
│   └── utils/
\`\`\`

By enforcing a strict contract where domains can only communicate through defined entry points (\`index.ts\`), you prevent spaghetti code and make future migrations a breeze.

## 2. Enforcing Strict Type boundaries
Leverage TypeScript’s absolute imports and strict path mapping to lock down internal domain logic. Use ESLint rules to prevent developers from importing directly into the private folders of another domain.

## 3. Bundle Budgets & Performance Guards
Implement rigid bundle budgets within your compiler configurations. If any single feature bundle exceeds **50KB gzipped**, the build system should generate warning alerts or actively block the integration pipeline.

# Implementing CSP in Complex SPAs

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a critical defensive system designed to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection exploits. However, many developers avoid setting strict headers because it risks breaking visual layout systems or block third-party analytics trackers.

Here is the step-by-step guideline for implementing a rigid CSP that keeps your app secure and fully functional.

## The Problem: Dynamic Script Injections
Traditional SPA tools inject inline styles and dynamic script bundles on the fly. Under a secure CSP, rules like \`unsafe-inline\` and \`unsafe-eval\` must be **fully banned**.

## The Solution: Strict CSP Matrix
To secure your frontend without breaking dynamic updates:

1. **Use Nonces for Hydrated Scripts**: Generate a cryptographic cryptographically random single-use token (nonce) on the backend for each request and bind it to script tags.
2. **Hash Static Bundles**: Include SHA-256 hashes of known vendor files inside your header instructions:
   \`\`\`http
   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'sha256-abc...'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-hashes';
   \`\`\`
3. **Connect-src Constraints**: Explicitly white-list the exact domain API endpoints that the client-side state is allowed to query.

By enforcing these simple guards, you close the primary loops exploited by malicious browser injectors.

# The Logic of Latency: Perceived Performance Optimization

If a page loads in 1.2 seconds but flashes blank screens three times, users perceive it as sluggish. Conversely, if a page takes 2 seconds but guides attention smoothly with transition physics, it feels instantaneous. 

Visual performance is about **perceived latency**, not just raw network timings.

## 1. Eliminate Cumulative Layout Shifts (CLS)
Always reserve spaces for asynchronous content using elegant skeleton blocks. A layout that shifts even slightly when an image loads causes cognitive distress to the user.

## 2. Dynamic Priority Queuing
Do not load all API feeds in parallel. Sequence them:
- **Priority 1**: Immediate visible viewport (e.g., Hero title, main visual)
- **Priority 2**: Secondary functional states (e.g., buttons, interactables)
- **Priority 3**: Below-the-fold telemetry metrics

## 3. Optimistic Visual Reconciliations
When a user toggles an option or submits a form, do not force them to wait for the network round-trip. Instantly update the client-side interface to show the successful target state, and silently resolve the action in the background. If a network failure occurs, execute a graceful, animated rollback.
